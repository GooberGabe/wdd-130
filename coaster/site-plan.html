      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>Whether you’re a roller-coaster junkie like me or you just like to visit amusement parks with your friends every now and then, you probably wish there was a better way of knowing a few things– what amusement parks are nearby? What kinds of rides do they have, and which ones are the best? What rides or attractions would best suit me and my preferences? Well, what if there was a website you could visit that could quickly answer all your ride-related questions and more? RideAdvisor takes into account your personal amusement preferences and helps you find the parks and rides that you’ll love the most. Forget waiting in line after line to finally come across your perfect roller coaster ride– instead, you can peruse reviews by like-minded coaster critics and find the park and ride for you, local or nationwide! </p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>My intended audience broadly consists of anybody from casual theme-park enjoyers to hardcore roller coaster enthusiasts. My website would solve a variety of problems these individuals often face, such as avoiding long wait times or knowing what rides fit a user's personal preferences (intensity, height, etc).</p>  <!-- change this -->

      <!--  The colors you choose for a website are one of the most important decisions you will make. Follow the instructions on the activity in iLearn then return and replace the color codes below with the hex color codes (the 6 digit numbers that show at the bottom of each color) for the colors you have chosen below.  You should have at least 2 colors but do not have to fill in all 4 if you do not need them.  -->

        Content
      </h2>
      <h3>Home page</h3>
      <p>The home page would provide a welcoming landing point for users that would showcase what the website is for and how it is used.</p>
      <p>Images for the Home page</p>

      </ul>
      <h3>Critical Reviewing</h3>
      <p>
        Everyone knows that not all rides are created equal. The website would have a system where viewers could search and peruse various reviews of different rides, both from dedicated critics and casual crowdsourcing, to learn everything they need to know about a ride. Casual riders could get insights into what rides might suit their milder tastes. Parents could get insights into which rides might be better suited for their children. Diehard adrenaline junkies could handpick the most intense rides at the park. 
      </p>
      <p>The rides would use a 1-5 rating system to measure their intensity. This score would be crowdsourced, as users could input how intense they felt the ride was on a scale of 1 to 5. In addition to that, reviewers can also leave their own comments which can be viewed and read by users of the site. 

      </p>
      <p>In addition to reviews, each ride listed would also supply an expected wait time in minutes, calculated by a number of factors (averaged wait times inputted by reviewers and current weather conditions, for example). Users of the site would have the option of sorting based on wait times (or a number of other factors).</p>

      </ul>
      <h3>Explore</h3>
      <p>
        Obviously without access to any kind of database to provide information, I would need to supply placeholder information for all of these categories. The website would provide the user with the ability to explore a variety of amusement parks, carnivals, or theme parks in their area, and then within each of those, they would be able to look at individual rides and attractions. The main appeal of the website would be the ability to quickly locate rides that might interest the user, and provide them with a way to explore the world of recreation with ease. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Before deciding to visit an amusement park, the user could glance over a few of the available rides and decide which rides interest them based on intensity, line length, or height restrictions. They could get a feel for the ride generally before going. It’s an IMDb for amusement park rides, if you will.
      </p>
      <p>This page would also have a "featured" section toward the top with a featured ride or park for the day or week.</p>
